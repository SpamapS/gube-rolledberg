Gube Rolledberg - A place for wasting time

Work got you down?

Want to play with code again?

This is a game.

Make the most inefficient, ridiculous versions of hello-world. PR them to me.
Let's celebrate the stupidity possible in code.

Rules:

- All code is licensed with the GPLv3. It's the least efficient license.
- New languages are extra fun. Pick a language and enjoy the moronic ways that it can waste time.
- Mind the planet. Inefficient is fine, but nothing that would say, require its own coal plant to complete.
- Other than this documentation, please do not put any documentation in files. This is about the code.
- Comments are discourage.
- Tell the story in commit messages. Long ones, terse ones, alt languages, whatever. Confuse me.
- The worse the name, the better.
